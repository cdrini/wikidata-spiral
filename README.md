Originally created as a means to explore Wikidata's subclass hierarchy, Wikidata Spiral proved to be more useful in visualizing art. However it is generic enough to explore almost any property. One limitation of this view is that it depends on the presence of the image property on entities (which is why it works so well for artists). Hopefully this will promote the addition of more images to Wikidata.
